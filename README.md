> [!NOTE]
>In web design, the parallax effect, or parallax scrolling (from the English scroll - scrolling),
>â€” a visual effect in which background objects move more slowly than foreground elements.
>Parallax scrolling technology when used on a website gives a feeling of dynamics and depth.

* This is the displacement of a close object relative to a distant one when the viewing angle changes.
 Thanks to this effect, we see objects in volume, perceive depth and understand what is closer and what is further. 
 On websites, the image is flat, and the designer can only create the illusion of volume. The parallax effect can help with this.
> [!TIP] 
> Where is parallax used?
>Parallax is used in geodesy and astronomy to measure the distance to distant objects. 
>In astronomy, this is a quantity equal to the apparent displacement of space objects,
>depending on the movement of the observer in space.
